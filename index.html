                                    “I am Sneha Biju and I live in the garden city, Bangalore. Im currently pursuing BTECH in Nitte Meenakshi. I have chosen Artificail Intelligence and Machine Learning. Our family consists of my father, my loving mother,my grandparent and my pets. My father is a mechanical engineer whereas my mother is a civil engineer. A lot of caring moments and love, is always what I get from everyone in my family. 
								
                                    I studied in Mothe Teresa Public School, which has always fed me to be motivated towards the future. All of my virtues have been incorporated in me by my school and helping is one of them. My school always aimed at the holistic development of a student and it focuses on the fact that we develop both morally as well as academically. It is always a part of learning that you try to inculcate virtues in yourself by being an honest person.
                                     
                                    To be responsible and to adhere to your duties. I always try to improve my skills and morals to become a better student. I completed my 1st and 2nd puc in St.Claret PU College. Haqving a bio background, I was not confident enough to take up this branch but parents always motivated me. I am a bookworm and I enjoy reading various types of novels as well as classic literature like Shakespearean dramas. 
                                    
                                    I also love to go through Indian history as I have a deep interest in knowing about it. Apart from reading, I am very fond of writing poems of my choice. Recently, I am also focussing on Learning guitar.
    
                                    To be honest, I am also fond of social media and love to play online games. Being flawless is not the nature of a human being. It is practically impossible, to not be flawed. Everyone in this world is trying hard to achieve their goals in this world. Therefore, setting your own trend, is what will define your capability”.

                                    My name is B V Vynavi, and I specialise in machine learning and intelligence. I chose AI & ML because it has a lot of potential and because I'm interested in math and wanted to study something that involved logic. Because AI & ML has programmes that require a logical mind, I sometimes wonder if choosing engineering was the right decision because sometimes this course is so boring and I often feel like I don't even understand the fundamentals of programming (because I haven't studied it before but still).

I am blessed to have friends who I can rely on. Moreover, my teachers are very supportive and caring, ensuring that I do not fall behind on my learning. I even managed to learn foreign languages such as French, which I hope may become useful one day. Academically, I may not be the brightest student, 
																
																but I still manage to clear all my papers without any backlogs. I believe that I have the skills required to easily socialize with people. I can make friends easily and without much effort. I love sports, especially football. I always take part in all the sports activities that my school conducts. I always pay attention to my studies and inspire my friends to focus on my studies.My family is a cross-cultural extended family where my uncles, aunts, grandparents, cousins, etc. live together.

																Im very passionate towards coding. I am a very adventurous person too and like to take the risk. I like to do a creative thing besides doing old stuff again and again. Learning new things is one thing which I always enjoy. I always update myself with the news. Without good career planning, right from the start, one can’t be on the right track. One has to set the goals in accordance with his or her broad career goals.
																
																These are all the things which express me. Though nobody can be described in a few sets of sentences. One needs to have yet command of oneself before going to write something about his life. Life is meant to be lived avidly and with visualization to do good for your fellow beings. Keeping this aim in mind, I have always desired to serve my people in whatever capacity I can.
